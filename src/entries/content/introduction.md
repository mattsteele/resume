---

I am a Software Engineer with 8 years of experience. I build web applications in JavaScript-based frameworks like Vue, Angular & Node. Much of my work is application prototyping, design systems tooling, and proof-of-concept work. My focus is on creating engaging, accessible & performant interfaces for humans.
